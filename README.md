# Feed_Snorlax

> Improved version of my first simple JavaScript game (Furry_Game) 
(added random opponent, sounds and one fruit more to collect, speed of game increases and background changes after the score is getting higher)

## How to play?
* Use keyboard arrows to direct Snorlax.
* Collect as many apples and oranges as you can.
* Remember - don't bump into the wall!
* Beware the other Pokemon!
